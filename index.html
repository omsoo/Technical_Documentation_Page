          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
          environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.</li>
        </ul>

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
            page about JavaScript.</li>

        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
          to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
          variable, because it is available only within that function.
          <br>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a
          block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code
          will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
          block, which in this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <code>
          if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
        </code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <br>
        <code>
          if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
        </code>

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
          code:
        </p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br>
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
          With the keyword var. For example,
          <code>
            var x = 42.
          </code>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        </p> <br>
        <code>x = 42.</code> <br>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
          sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
